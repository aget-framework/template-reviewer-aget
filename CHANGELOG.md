## [3.16.0] - 2026-05-02

**Theme**: Aligned with framework v3.16.0 (Framework-Discipline Closure + Wave-1A Spec Contracts + /aget-go Production)

### Changed

- Version bump: 3.15.0 → 3.16.0 (framework alignment)
- `AGENTS.md` `@aget-version` updated to 3.16.0
- **Universal-skills migration (#1120)**: 15 missing universal skills added from worker baseline (advisor/analyst/architect/consultant/developer/executive/operator/researcher/reviewer/spec-engineer pre-bump count 19 → post-migration 34, then post-archetype-fit-revert 31 = 29 universal + 2 archetype-specific).
- **Release-triad revert (CAP-TPL-016-07 NEW)**: 3 release-triad skills (`aget-release-build`, `aget-release-audit-specs`, `aget-release-critique`) removed from this template — moved to release-execution archetype catalog (worker, supervisor only). Closes the "presence-not-fit" misfit surfaced by Gate 1 defects audit.

### Compatibility

- **No breaking changes** in v3.16. Existing instances upgrade by version-bump only.
- Optional adoption: `**Plan_Status**:` / `**Gate_Status:**` schema in new PROJECT_PLAN files (CAP-PP-003 disambiguation; backward-compatible).

## [3.15.0] - 2026-04-25

**Theme**: Aligned with framework v3.15.0 (Two-Level Model Coherence + Security Hardening)

### Changed

- Version bump: 3.14.0 → 3.15.0 (framework alignment)
- `AGENTS.md` `@aget-version` updated to 3.15.0

### Breaking

- **BC-001**: `.aget/version.json` old field names removed (e.g. `agent_name` → `aget_agent_name`). See `aget/docs/BREAKING_CHANGES_v3.15.md`.
- **BC-002**: `--fix` flag removed from `/aget-check-health` (SKILL-003). Use `/aget-enhance-health` instead.

---

## [3.14.0] - 2026-04-18

**Theme**: Aligned with framework v3.14.0 (v3.13 Loop Closure + Scope-Lock Discipline)

### Changed

- Version bump: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0 (framework alignment)
- `AGENTS.md` `@aget-version` updated to 3.14.0

### Notes

Per-template CHANGELOG entries for 3.12.0 and 3.13.0 were not individually maintained; template work in those cycles is captured in `aget-framework/aget/CHANGELOG.md`. Gap flagged for v3.14.x / v3.15 retrospective.
